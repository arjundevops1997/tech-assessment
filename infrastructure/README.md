VPC and Subnets: The VPC provides isolated network space for the microservices. Public and private subnets are created for resources that need public internet access (like load balancers) and those that should be private (like databases).

ECS Cluster: ECS is used to manage and run containers. The cluster provides scalable infrastructure for deploying microservices.

Route 53 DNS: DNS namespaces are configured in Route 53 for service discovery. This allows services to communicate with each other using named aliases.

For Deployment:  Run terraform init to initialize Terraform. Run terraform apply to create the infrastructure.
